Example 2D Platformer students and I create together week 2-ish of Game Design B.

The goal of this project is to give the students some familiarity with working in Unity, and to show them how one might work through problems/ideas they encounter when making their games. This includes:
- Left/right controls
- Camera control
- Flipping sprites back and forth
- Ground check and jumping
- Animating sprite during movement (e.g., jumping)
- Working with sprite tiles
- Collecting items
- Adding a background image to the scene
- End scene
